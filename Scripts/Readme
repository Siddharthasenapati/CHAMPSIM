To run Champsim
Copy scripts/run_champsim.sh to the ChampSim root directory and change TRACE_DIR in run_champsim.sh to specify 
the path of the trace.

//To Run champsim of single core
./run_champsim.sh bimodal-no-no-lru-1core 1 10 bzip2_183B

$ ./run_champsim.sh ${binary} ${n_warm} ${n_sim} ${trace} ${option}

//FOR HIGHER CORES

./run_4core.shbimodal-no-no-lru-1core 1 10 2

$ ./run_4core.sh ${binary} ${n_warm} ${n_sim} ${num} ${option}

${num}: mix number is the corresponding line number written in sim_list/4core_workloads.txt

While running for higher cores num specifies the location of trace in core_workloads.txt

similarly we can go for higher cores
